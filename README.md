## Hi there, I'm Harish

A seasoned software engineer and lifelong learner. I’m passionate about building reliable, scalable systems and constantly expanding my knowledge. Giving back to the community is a core part of my journey 🎯

> World-class software can be built anywhere — even from a quiet village 💚

👯 I’m eager to collaborate on open source projects, primarily with ReactJS and NodeJS.

🥅 **2024 Goals:** Deepen expertise in system design, contribute meaningfully to open source, and advance full-stack development skills.

✅ Always open to new challenges and learning opportunities.

⚡ **Fun fact:** I once answered the world’s oldest question with a single line of JavaScript 🙈🙈🙈

```javascript
// Which came first: the chicken or the egg?
console.log(["🥚", "🐣", "🐥", "🐔"].sort())

>>> ["🐔", "🥚", "🐣", "🐥"];

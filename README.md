## Hi there, I'm Harish

As a software engineer passionate about building resilient, scalable backend systems, I’m always exploring new ways to improve infrastructure and observability. Every day is a chance to deepen my understanding of distributed systems and system design — the foundation of reliable software.

> Great software isn’t bound by location — it can be built anywhere, even from a quiet village 💚

✅ Always eager to learn, adapt, and grow.

⚡ **Fun fact:** When faced with bugs, I prefer to debug them like a pro — by turning it off and on again. Sometimes the oldest tricks are the best!
